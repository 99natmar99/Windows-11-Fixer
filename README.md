## Known Issues
### Fix Windows Page
- Some fixes request the user to restart their computer in order for those fixes to take effect. Sometimes those fixes only require a Windows explorer restart rather than a full computer restart.
- The small taskbar fix results in the taskbar clock and system tray icons to be cut off.
- Icon spacing varies throughout the taskbar size fixes.
- When adding or removing take ownership, the registry prompt may sometimes not appear as the topmost window.

### Windows Settings Page
- Some setting changes may result in a terminal window appearing with "error code 1" present. This just means that a registry value the program was trying to delete was not found. You can ignore and close this window.

### Uninstall MS Bloat Page
- Some Edge files may still remain until a computer restart has been performed.

### Install Software Page
- Some programs which are installed through the Microsoft Store (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+) require the user to be currently logged into a Microsoft account in the Microsoft store.
- After installaing software, sometimes Windows 11 Fixer will remain frozen and is required to be closed and reopened in order to continue using it.
